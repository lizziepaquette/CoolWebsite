<h2>
        Hello and welcome to my shitty website!
</h2>

<p>

I have made this shitty website all from scratch. Could I have made a nice one on Blogspot or Wordpress or Squarespace or Godaddy or any of user friendly website makers?

<iframe src="yes.html" height="100" width="70" style="border:none;"></iframe>

</p>

<p>

But I am trying to become a well rounded do-it-yourself coder and you've got to start somewhere. If you know some cool HTML from back when MySpace was a thing or something enter it here:

<form>
  <br><input type="text" name="good entering"><br>
</form>


Just kidding that box doesn't work. Sometimes I think of life as this upgrade game. 

<a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/ArmorGames/upgrade-complete?acomplete=upgrad">click here!</a>

If you don't want to click the link here's a screen shot. 

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/upgrade.JPG" alt="Look a pic!" style="width:304px;"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

And right now we're just at the first level.
